chapter_2

Extra credit:
- I was correct about # character.  I refer to this as the pound sign.
- In reviewing the code, I did find mis-types in the commented part
  - Line 7, char 23 - missing a period
  - Line 4 and 9, I intentionally used single quotes instead of double since there
    was no interpolation.
- When I read my code out loud, I did not find any additional errors.

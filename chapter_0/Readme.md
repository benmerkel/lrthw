What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Skill #1 - Reading and Writing: The point here is that you need to at
least have some fundamental skill of being able to read, write, and type
fairly effectively to be able to write code.  Just as one probably
wouldn't be able to write in French if they couldn't at least speak the
language

Skill #2 - Attention to Detail: Writing code is an exact process.  Missing
the smallest detail can break code so being very careful and deliberate 
about what you write is necessary.

Skill #3 - Spotting Differences: While working through these exercises,
we will be copying code from the book exactly as they are written.  This
means that being able to quickly identify differences between the two
will avoid code problems or at least help identify the errors quicker.
In practice, this also helps to be able to view code and be able to 
identify bugs and other issues faster.

Q. Why do you need to not copy and paste?
A. We don't want to copy and paste because (for now) we are trying to
train our brains, hands and mind to read, write and see code.  Copying
and Pasting skips denies us the opportunity to instill these essential
skills.
